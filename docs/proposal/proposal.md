## SECTION B


### Introduction

Our project will be used for finding and filtering through activities in your area. These activities can range
from restaurants to sporting events to concerts to parks. They can be free activities or paid activities.
These activities will be filtered based on several different parameters that
can be input by the user upon opening the application. It will learn about the user and recommend new activities that they might like based on other users and using machine learning.
It will give the user the ability to search many websites data at 
one time and filter the events they may be interested in and may have missed due to lack of research or not knowing about.

### Outline

Our project will be an android application built using android studio for the gui and python for the backend features. We
will be using a mixture of API's and web scraping to gather the data as well as user input what will be automatically screened.
The raw data will be cleaned and automatically categorized by several fixed categories using machien learning. These categories will be picked by what we have trained
it to pick and that can be later filtered. This will be processed and then stored in a database. It will be an interactive site and users will have the ability to 
leave comments and reviews on events for others to see as well as adding more details about the venue eg. wheelchair access or free parking.
We plan on implementing machine learning algorithms in order to build up a profile of each users interests in order to more accurately predict and 
prioritise what activities might interest them more. Users will also be able to manually input interests and things about themselves to help with recommendations too.
We also wish to implement a friends feature where mutual friends and people with mutual interests will be recommended similar events and notified that their friends
are going in. The goal for this is to notify people that people they may know are going to the same event as them in case they were not aware.  

### Background

The idea came about based on some work done on INTRA and personal experience looking for something to do when with a group of people or on your own.
It can be any mix of people with different connections like family, friends or strangers who want to do something.
It might be used for something like a new place to bring your dog on a walk or to a restraunt that offers a student discount.
People and activities can be categorised and the best matched activities can be picked. 

### Achievements

It can be used by all ages to find activities best suited to that person or group with price, transport and required skill kept in mind.
Encourage people with similar interests to go to events together or even just notify people that friends are going in case they didn't know.
Assist users in discovering new things to do based on interests. (Eg. Recommend new Italian restaurant for people who like Italian food).

### Justification

The idea behind the app is that it can be used whenever the user wants to do something with a group or by themselves. 
It will filter through all events, public places and things in the area. It will give people an opportunity to do things they might not have even thought about and puts all 
the information in an easy to see structure.
There are no apps out there which include major events/small gatherings all in the one place. Before this a user would have to visit many different sites/social media to see this.


### Programming language(s)

- Java (Android Studio)
- Python (Backend)


### Programming tools / Tech stack

- Android Studio
- Database (SSMS or Firebase because of integration with Android studio)

### Learning Challenges

- Learning advanced level of android studio
- APIs to retrieve the data from various sources.
- Automation of retrieving data and categorizing the data.
- Machiene learning
- Implimenting user profiles
- Security and data protection

### Breakdown of work

Most aspects of the project are new to both of us so we will be evenly distributing most of the work
to maximize learning experience for both of us using pair programming. We want to do it as a peer to peer learning where we teach each other as we do the project.
